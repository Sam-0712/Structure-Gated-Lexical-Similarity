# Structure-Gated-Lexical-Similarity
Solving LLM-generated dense edits in writing correction: Our Hybrid-DiceAlignment combines multi-order N-gram Dice coefficients (segments) + affine gap-penalty NW alignment (sequences) + recursive character alignment with chunk merging. Zero-dependency design for low-resource environments, ensuring explainable character-level refinement.
